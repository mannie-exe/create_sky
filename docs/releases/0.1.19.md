# Create Sky 0.1.19

Update Create Sky Compat to 0.5.2. Minecraft remains 1.21.1, NeoForge 21.1.264,
Analog Audio 0.1.5-hotfix.1 and Create 6.0.10.

## Radio compatibility

Compat now repairs Analog Audio's reflective Create registry lookup, restoring
registration of its existing radio movement handler. This removes the associated
startup exception. The adapter activates only for the affected version pair.

The fix changes no recipes, building weights, terrain or Sable audio handling.
Ordinary Create contraption GUI support and audible playback during movement
remain separate playtest limitations. Power Grid keeps its working Java fallback
on macOS; no backend setting changes are needed.

## Verification and maintenance

The old Compat release fails the radio-registration control; 0.5.2 passes checks
with neither optional mod, each alone, both together and the full pack. The full
pack retains Create's control drill handler, and radio server callbacks complete
without loading client classes. Build, package, resource and authoring checks
passed. See the [compatibility evidence](development/compatibility.md) and
[dependency maintenance](development/patches.md) for scope and update procedures.

Atlas app changes are excluded from this release's commits and payloads.
No new recipes or weight projections are needed for this registration fix.

Previous releases: [0.1.18](releases/0.1.18.md), [0.1.17](releases/0.1.17.md).
