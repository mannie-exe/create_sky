# World generation

New worlds use **Create Sky Islands**, preset `create_sky_compat:islands_v1`, from
[Create Sky Compat](https://github.com/mannie-exe/create-sky-compat). The manifest
pins the installed mod version. Compat extends Sky Archipelago 1.3.6 and is
required on both client and server. Ordinary Sky Archipelago presets retain
upstream generation with the village-neighbor filter.

## Terrain

The authored profile is `overrides/common/config/create_sky_compat-generation.json`.

| Control | Pack setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build range | Y=-128 through 767 | Includes terrain and building space |
| Cluster grid | 2400 blocks, jitter 750 | Cell spacing and bounded center displacement |
| Activation | 0.85 | Candidate activation before biome and clearance rejection |
| Anchor center | Y=200 to 490 | Intersected with the safe band for the selected body |
| Anchor height target | 250 to 400 blocks | Realized height varies with relief and erosion |
| Anchor radius | 270 to 370 blocks | Descriptor radius, not an exact shoreline |
| Companion radius/orbit | 40 to 110 / 470 to 680 blocks | Relative to the host anchor |
| Companion vertical offset | -60 to +50 blocks | Adjusted to fit the dimension |
| Floor/building clearance | 32 / 200 blocks | Reserved inside the build range |
| Minimum cluster gap | 350 blocks | Complete terrain-density supports, not structures |

Deterministic priority rejects candidates whose complete cluster support bounds
would violate the minimum gap. Wider jitter can therefore remove a candidate;
it does not allow neighboring clusters to overlap. Grid spacing is not a guaranteed
travel distance: shores, companions, biome exclusions and missing clusters affect
the actual crossing. The tallest target requires an anchor center
of at least Y=268. Curved undersides avoid the upstream density discontinuity.
The fresh-world fallback checks generated support and headroom before setting spawn;
it does not relocate existing worlds or create a platform.

### Geology and features

Ores, selected underground features, deepslate, classic carvers and cave biomes
use an anchor-relative geological frame. Reference Y=-64 maps to its geological
bottom and Y=64 to its surface datum. Higher reference positions retain their
vertical offset above that datum. Companions share the frame, so thin islands do
not receive a complete compressed ore column.

Native vein shapes, replacement rules, exposure checks and initial attempt counts
remain authoritative. Coverage includes vanilla Overworld ores, Create zinc and
striated deposits, and Propulsion platinum. Nether/End generation is unchanged.
Compat 0.5.0 also restores native large iron/copper veins in
the same geological frame, including their raw-ore blocks and associated stone.
Ordinary ore features remain separate. No large zinc or platinum veins are added.
Temperature queries use reference Y=64 so biome climate is independent of island
altitude. Cold biomes remain cold; altitude cooling above mountains is absent.

### Interiors and local water

The preset explicitly uses OVERLAP to retain lower island bodies. Cavities are
subtracted within each contributing island before surviving rock is combined;
one island's hollow cannot erase another island's rock. The exterior shape and
taper remain unchanged. Geological depth uses the original anchor frame, not
the thickness of a remaining cavern roof.

`create_sky_compat-interiors.json` selects noise interiors with probability 0.55,
hollows with 0.18, and baseline interiors otherwise. These are descriptor choices,
not measured percentages of land. The shell is 12 blocks; selected openings can
cut through it. Hollows retain rock pillars. Native classic carvers remain enabled.
These custom cavities do not import the complete vanilla continental density router.

`create_sky_compat-water.json` attempts local basins on 0.22 of eligible anchors,
then rejects unsupported layouts. Radii are 20 to 36 and depths 6 to 12 blocks.
Overflow and underside-outlet choices are 0.25 and 0.20; other admitted basins are
enclosed. The outlet budget is one, two blocks wide, with three-block lining.
Source water and its retaining bed/rim survive classic carving. Native fluid ticks
produce the falls; this is not a global sea-level change or complete aquifer retrofit.

Mangrove surfaces receive mud unless an existing upstream material override applies.
Lush and dripstone biome projection includes retained lower bodies. Deep Dark and
ancient-city eligibility retain the upper exterior's geological band; lower bodies
do not independently acquire another city band or exterior grass cap.

`create_sky_compat-oceans.json` keeps ocean experiments disabled. The available
forms are an enclosed ocean basin, a beach/coast basin and a small water island
with a falling perimeter. Native vegetation and biome spawn lists are present in
tested examples; natural populations, coral acquisition and ocean progression are
not certified. Enabling them changes generation identity and requires a fresh world.

The mod's [terrain reference](https://github.com/mannie-exe/create-sky-compat/blob/main/docs/development/terrain.md)
owns feature coverage and implementation. Its
[configuration reference](https://github.com/mannie-exe/create-sky-compat/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)
owns geometry validation. Pack configuration above owns the selected values.

### Villages and atmosphere

Each anchor draws a village allowance of zero to three, weighted `96:24:8:3`.
Companions share it. Biome, layout and clearance rejection can reduce actual
counts. Villages float beside terrain, with their height relative to the host
surface datum. [Structures](structures.md) owns pack loot, crop and salvage policy.

Aeronautics Delivery Quests uses a 500-block horizontal route minimum, a
6000-block destination-search offset limit and a 120-minute time limit. The
locator can resolve farther away; the search offset is not a final route cap.
Compat retains endpoint chunk tickets until finalization and retries rejected
Sky Village landings within their bounds using ADQ's original safety predicate.

The Sable integration sets pressure to 1.0 at Y=508, 0.8 at 600, 0.5 at 680 and
zero at the exclusive ceiling of 768. Gravity and drag retain Sable defaults.
Pressure follows world altitude, not each island's local surface.

### Evidence and limits

Earlier density samples cover six anchors across seeds 42 and 8675309.
Each used one chunk per stratum in a 7-by-7 grid. All contained zinc, iron, copper,
coal, redstone, andesite, diamond and platinum. No emerald was observed; sparse
samples cannot establish absence. Observed blocks and area-weighted estimates
are separate, and neither proves mining access or survival scarcity.

The qualified 0.5.0 survey separately samples three anchors on seed 42 with
interiors, large veins and local water enabled. Atlas displays its artifact hash,
reference-depth ore bands and ore adjacent to air or fluid. Exposure excludes
chunk-edge columns and does not establish a reachable mining route. Keep these
samples distinct from the server's dated saved-world survey and older density runs.

Earlier creative flight checks demonstrated a glued cargo balloon, save/reopen
and an outward/return crossing of roughly 1.5 km each way. Those are historical
checks on the earlier terrain version, not current-grid fuel budgets or wing-borne
flight evidence. Delivery endpoint checks do not establish completed deliveries.
Exact versions, hashes, samples and limits belong in the mod's
[verification record](https://github.com/mannie-exe/create-sky-compat/blob/main/docs/development/verification.md).

The Atlas keeps saved-world surveys separate from imported isolated surveys.
[World data](web/data.md#island-generation-surveys) describes provenance and import.
Remaining play checks include cave access, mining time, flight budgets, survival
controls and delivery completion. No recipe changes compensate for thin terrain.

## Cluster visibility

The 2026-10-26 stopped-world survey uses seed `-3702386035254534638` and
`islands_v1-prototype-10`. Its recorded geometry matches the installed configuration:
2400-block grid, ±750 displacement per horizontal axis, 0.85 candidate activation
and 350-block minimum support gap. Biome admission still rejects ocean-biome
anchors; clearance priority can reject another candidate. Sky Archipelago's
ordinary CONSISTENT/DYNAMIC and size presets do not set this geometry. OVERLAP
retains intersecting vertical bodies; it does not override inter-cluster clearance.

A native descriptor survey using that exact seed, artifact and embedded settings
found 30 anchor centers within 10,000 blocks of the origin. All their center chunks
were stored with full status, and every cluster had saved solid terrain at its
center or a bounded nearby sample; crescent/crater centers need not contain land.
Nearest-other-anchor distances were 1968–3148 blocks, median 2204. Each had 1–6
other anchor centers within 4096 blocks, median 4. These are center distances;
two distinct nearest-center pairs had sampled solid-column shore gaps of 1047
and 1230 blocks on a 16-block grid. Those gaps are neither exact routes nor a
minimum guaranteed shoreline distance. The sampled nearest support gaps were
428–1700 blocks; support bounds deliberately overestimate occupied terrain.

At spawn (-836, 445, 852), other cluster centers are approximately 2144, 2809,
3221 and 3800 blocks away. This supports nearby inter-cluster sightlines in range,
not visibility from every point: foreground terrain, altitude and camera direction
can obscure them. Farther clusters are expected to fall outside a finite view.

### Local rendering limits

| Setting inspected on 2026-10-26 | Value | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client DH radius | 256 chunks / 4096 blocks | Nominal distant-terrain rendering radius |
| Client and server vanilla view | 12 chunks / 192 blocks | Nearby full-detail chunks |
| Client simulation / server simulation | 12 / 10 chunks | Does not extend distant rendering |
| DH pregen request | 1024 chunks / 16384 blocks around spawn | Prepared data area, not a camera range |
| Server DH sync/generation request caps | 4096 chunks each | Request permission, not a client render setting |
| Server DH live-update radius | 256 chunks / 4096 blocks | Changed-chunk notifications |
| Local client/server per-player DH bandwidth | 2048 KB/s | Tuned transfer cap; cached LOD delivery is still queued |
| Client DH cave culling | Disabled | Avoids the stock low-altitude cave cutoff |

The 4096-chunk request caps are confirmed by DH 3.3.3's
`AbstractDhServerLevel`: it converts section-to-player block distance to chunks
before checking those settings. Client DH renderer mode is DEFAULT, with MEDIUM
horizontal/vertical quality and BLOCK maximum horizontal resolution. The
shader-off DH fog begins at 0.4 of render distance (about 1638 blocks) and reaches
its configured end at 4096, using exponential-squared falloff. These values do not
establish the active shader's fog behavior.

The selected shader is Complementary Unbound r5.9.3 with Euphoria Patches 1.10.5,
with `ATM_FOG_DISTANCE=150`. In its DH path, atmospheric fog uses
`1-exp2(-max(distance-40,0)*(0.4+0.4*rain)/150)`, then applies density, altitude,
weather and cave/light factors. The value 150 is not a 150-block cutoff. Shader
fog can substantially reduce distant contrast even when LOD data is available.
The spacing/fog inspection did not launch a client or change rendering settings.
Later live transfer tuning is recorded in [DH cache filling](compatibility.md#transfer-tuning).
The measured spacing does not by itself justify increasing DH's radius; consider
fog and data-transfer readiness before changing terrain or rendering budgets. The
subsequent [cache-filling investigation](compatibility.md#dh-multiplayer-cache-filling)
found available server LODs missing from the client's cache, nearest-first requests
and logged rate limiting. Visibility after an approach/return is therefore evidence
of data readiness, not sufficient evidence of a render-distance or fog cutoff.

## Ordinary Sky Archipelago worlds

The retained TOML and `eee` preset use CONSISTENT spacing 1494. They preserve the
ordinary preset used before 0.1.12 and do not control Compat's expanded geometry.
Keep those settings with existing ordinary worlds.

Sky Archipelago 1.3.6 DYNAMIC selects one spacing for the whole world from its
layout seed. It does not vary spacing independently between clusters. The former
32 to 1500 range yielded 33 to 1465 across 64 inspected seeds. CONSISTENT 1494
retained the comparison seed's scale without that cross-seed density variation.
Shapes, biome eligibility and companions still vary; cell spacing is not edge gap.
The comparison matched 16 descriptors and 81 column profiles for that seed, not
ore inventories, structures or safe routes.

## Biome compatibility and updates

Keep `mixin.perf.biome=false` in `zfastnoise.mixin.properties`: Zfastnoise's biome
optimization conflicts with Sky Archipelago's Deep Dark projection redirect.
`mixin.perf.noise=true` remains enabled. The configured boots no longer reported
the collision; that does not establish ancient-city availability.

Compat records generation identity in each expanded-preset world and rejects
incompatible changes or unmarked existing terrain. Preserve the original mod,
configuration and marker with a save. Never delete the marker to force adoption
of incompatible chunks. New geometry requires a separate new world.

Distributed server templates leave the seed blank. Compare disposable worlds
with identical seeds, artifacts and resolved settings, then sample other seeds
before generalizing. [Patch maintenance](patches.md) covers dependency review;
[server maintenance](../players/server.md) covers backups and updates.

## Same-seed world replacement and LODs

DH 3.3.3 sends a seed-derived level key when `server.levelKeyPrefix` is blank.
Different terrain regenerated with the same seed can reuse a client's old LOD key.
For a deliberate world replacement, set a unique new `levelKeyPrefix` in that
server's local DH config before launch. Keep `sendLevelKeys=true`; do not distribute
one fixed prefix to unrelated servers. Clients then select separate caches while
retaining previous files. Ordinary updates preserving terrain should preserve the key.
