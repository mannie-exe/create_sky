# Create Sky documentation

Player guides explain installation and operation. Development documents describe
pack authoring, compatibility constraints and verification. Historical decisions
record what was tested at the time; they do not define current defaults.

## Source and releases

Current defaults live in `overrides/` and `templates/`. Building source does not
update a downloaded release or an installed instance. Archived release notes
describe their named version; the unreleased notes describe the working tree.

Earlier releases: [0.1.18](releases/0.1.18.md), [0.1.17](releases/0.1.17.md), [0.1.16](releases/0.1.16.md), [0.1.15](releases/0.1.15.md), [0.1.14](releases/0.1.14.md), [0.1.13](releases/0.1.13.md), [0.1.12](releases/0.1.12.md),
